# My TMUX configuration

This is my TMUX configuration

## TPM usage
I used [TMUX plugin manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) for importing [jimeh/themepack](https://github.com/jimeh/tmux-themepack) plugin.
You'll find specific plugin usage instruction in the linked repos.

## Configurations
**TODO**

### Keys
**TODO**

### Simplicity is the key
Jokes aside, I tried to make it as possible.
You'll find a friend in <prefix> + ENTER. This command will spawn a text editor with your source tmux.conf

## Warning
You have to modify some paths inside .tmux.conf for making it working.
Path on repo defaults to home directory (**~/.tmux**)
